## ðŸ“Œ `company_merge.py` Details

**Purpose:**  
To merge duplicate HubSpot company records in bulk using the HubSpot API.

**How it works:**  
- Accepts a CSV file where:
  - **Column A** = HubSpot ID of Company 1  
  - **Column B** = HubSpot ID of Company 2  
- Merges each pair into a new record
- The old records remain untouched (or optionally can be removed via API later)
- HubSpot generates a new ID for the merged company

**Dependencies:**
- `requests`
- `pandas`
- HubSpot private app access token (passed securely via environment variable or config file)

**Security Note:**  
No access tokens are stored in this repository. Users must configure their own API credentials locally.
